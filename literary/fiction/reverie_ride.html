        <h1>Reverie Ride</h1>
        <p>
          The old laboratory smelled of used oil and death. The noise of
          sparking electricity was only deadened by the mechanical sound of
          gears turning. The walls were covered in grease and grime. And on
          rusty nails hung the tools for the job: saws, hammers, wrenches, and
          the lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dark figure stood in the middle of the dreadful room; not a man but
          neither machine. Forgotten and dead. No longer useful for anyone with
          a sane mind. Its chest open, guts spilled across the cold floor. In
          the great cavity of the trunk proper, viscera: the engine of the
          machine, loudly beating, <em>Bah-dun, Bah-dun</em>. The muffler, the
          wheezing lungs replaced. The vessel fuelled, not with dark blood, but
          with a viscous liquid.
        </p>
        <p>
          A being ought to be dead, forced to live once more! With the twist of
          a key, fire exploded in the creature&rsquo;s heart, and it screamed a
          most horrific scream. &ldquo;Kill me! Kill me!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;David! Will ya ever stop that racket?&rdquo; his boss barked at
          him. &ldquo;Sounds like somethin&rsquo; is wrong with the exhaust.
          It&rsquo;s like a banshee wailin&rsquo; in there. Go on and take a
          look at it.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          David turned off the engine and got out of the old car. He knew it
          would be a long day when the boys towed the beat up, rust-covered car
          into the repair shop that morning. He had never seen such a wreck
          before. It was something of a miracle that it didn&rsquo;t explode
          into a million pieces the moment he started the engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          David never imagined he&rsquo;d end up as a car repairman. He&rsquo;d
          earned a degree in mechanical engineering because he liked to tinker.
          But no matter how many years he spent in the shop, he could never get
          used to the environment of a proper mechanics&rsquo; garage. Not to
          the deafening noise of machinery, nor to the acrid bite of gasoline
          that seared his throat, or to the blinding overhead lights that made
          his eyes burn and itch. He wanted to leave, but money had to be made,
          so he kept working.
        </p>
        <p>
          The car was parked on a repair lift. With the press of a button, the
          hydraulic pistons of the car lift began to elevate the tons-of-scrap
          high into the air. Under it was the deep, dark void &mdash; a small
          trench &mdash; a hole in the floor made for mechanics to check the
          underside of a vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
          David zipped up his dirty, oil-stained work overalls. His uniform had
          an old iron-on patch, which was hanging onto hope and a single thread
          of fiber; it read: &rsquo;<strong
            >Niall&rsquo;s Automobile Service Agency</strong
          >&rsquo;. The logo of the repair shop was made to resemble that of a
          famous <em>space-aeronautics</em> company&rsquo;s. His overalls fixed,
          he put on his pressure helmet and closed the airlock door behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Btzzz</em> &ldquo;Culligan requesting clearance for extravehicular
          activity,&rdquo; David said into his radio.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Btzzz</em>&ldquo; Affirmative, you are cleared. Enjoy your
          spacewalk, David,&rdquo; a voice buzzed from his headset.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the last bit of air was sucked out of the airlock, the outer hatch
          opened up before him. With a strong push of his feet, he escaped the
          artificial gravity of the spaceship&rsquo;s flooring, and he
          gracefully glided out of the spacecraft. Now he was outside, as
          outside as any man can be. Swimming in the great ocean of nothingness.
          The only thing keeping him from flying into the mouth of emptiness
          &mdash; from being entirely enveloped by boundless blackness &mdash;
          was the tether supplying him with oxygen and keeping him attached to
          the spaceship. It was the umbilical cord between an unborn child and
          its mother. It was the only thing keeping him alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          One fails to comprehend the maddening vastness of space. And the
          silence that it holds. David could only hear his own breathing. And
          the disturbing loudness of a beating heart, like a distant drum,
          <em>Bah-dun, Bah-dun</em>. He could not tell if the darkness he saw
          was infinitely far away, or right in front of his helmet.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was just about finished repairing the spacecraft when a voice came
          in on his radio.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em>Btzzz</em>, Earth to David. Earth to David. Will ya snap
          out of it?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          David found himself firmly standing on his own two feet on the
          concrete floor of the repair shop. His boss stood at the edge of the
          mechanic&rsquo;s pit, looking down at him with a smirk.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Your head&rsquo;s off in the clouds again, is it?&rdquo; his
          boss asked.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Above,&rdquo; he muttered as he climbed out of the trench.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can bring this lass to life.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          They lowered the car and David got into the driver&rsquo;s seat. He
          took the keys out of his pocket and slid it into the ignition switch.
          He turned the key, and waited for the engine to catch. Reluctantly, it
          let out a low growl, followed by a couple of dry coughs, but
          eventually, the engine fell into an arrhythmic beat.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;There she purrs. Proper work, David.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          Proper work indeed, but he felt no satisfaction. Why waste the
          manpower and time when a metal-carcass such as this one is only good
          for scraps?
        </p>
        <p>
          As if it heard his thoughts, David felt the car rumbling and shaking
          beneath him. He instinctually grabbed onto the steering wheel, just to
          hold onto something. It was thrashing about like a raging bull.
        </p>
        <p>
          The car was screaming, but it did not wail or growl. It was roaring,
          roaring like a fiery beast. David&rsquo;s breath caught in his throat
          as thick black smoke filled the garage. The engine pulsated violently.
          Then with a deafening blast, fire erupted from the exhaust, consuming
          the vehicle entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          David felt his skin searing in the heat, sinking into the seat, and
          then he felt it no longer. He saw fire envelop him completely,
          blinding him with light, and then he saw it no longer. He heard
          screaming and yelling, and then he heard it no longer. He smelled the
          mixture of used oil and fresh blood, then he smelled it no longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          His heart was beating erratically, like an old engine after too many
          miles, <em>Bah-dun, Bah-dun, Bah&mdash;</em>.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p><em>I should see a therapist,</em> David thought.</p>
