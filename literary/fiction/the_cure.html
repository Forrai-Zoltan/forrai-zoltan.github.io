        <h1>The Cure</h1>
        <p>
          It was a late Friday night, and I could not fall asleep. Fat raindrops
          knocked heavily on my skylight window above me, and I kept tossing and
          turning in bed, for what seemed like an eternity. It was already past
          midnight when I sat up in my bed, slid into my slippers and went
          downstairs to the kitchen for a drink. I grabbed a cold beer from the
          fridge and plopped down on my couch to watch something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remote in hand, I mindlessly flicked through the static until I ended
          up on a late-night show called &lsquo;Freak of the Week&rsquo;, or
          something like that. It was the show of that irritating host George
          Reid, who each week interviewed some hapless weirdo. Witches,
          psychics, even a guy who believed he transformed into a werewolf in
          the moonlight were all on the menu to be ridiculed in front of a live
          audience. One time, they paraded a furloughed circus clown who claimed
          he could regenerate any limb lost &mdash; the most memorable episode
          by far. Despite the off-putting nature of its gimmick, the show became
          popular among insomniacs.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;... And that was Phil with the weather. Thank you, Philip, it
          seems we have to wait a little longer for sunny days, folks,&rdquo; he
          said with his well-practised smile. &ldquo;But that shouldn&rsquo;t be
          a problem for today&rsquo;s guest, Dr. Michael Hopkins. Welcome,
          Michael, thank you for coming,&rdquo; Reid turned to his guest sitting
          across from him.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you for inviting me, George.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
          Michael was a tall, gaunt figure with a pale complexion. The dark
          circles around his eyes matched his equally dark hair. Even with these
          imperfections, he was still an attractive, young-looking fellow.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Now Michael,&rdquo; Reid looked into his notes, &ldquo;You
          claim to have found a new treatment for an ailment that haunts so many
          of us, the unavoidable effects of ageing. Allegedly, you can treat
          people, even older than seventy, to feel and look like
          twenty-year-olds. Michael, care to elaborate?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;That is correct. I myself am nearing a hundred,&rdquo; he
          smiled at the camera, proudly showing off his pearly whites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reid paused for a second. &ldquo;That... I mean
          <em>wow</em> congratulations, that is miraculous.&rdquo; He started
          clapping, and the audience followed along. &ldquo;What is your secret?
          Carrot juice? Cardio?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;There is no secret, George, and miracle has nothing to do with
          it,&rdquo; he spoke calmly with an almost unnoticeable accent.
          &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a treatment my colleagues and I have developed over
          many many years.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Is it like a new form of plastic surgery? What does the
          treatment involve? Does it hurt?&rdquo; Reid asked, faking curiosity,
          or perhaps this was one of the few topics he was genuinely interested
          in.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I assure you George it does not hurt, the procedure is
          absolutely painless. And there is no plastic surgery involved. First,
          we put the patient into a deep sleep. Then we make two hematophagic
          punctures near the pharynx. After a few days, you can already feel the
          difference in your appearance and energy levels.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;And it also gets rid of wrinkles, as you claim? I might give
          you a visit after the show, my surgeon has lost his touch.&rdquo; He
          gave an insufferable grin to the audience, and they responded with a
          cheery laughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;I guarantee it, George, one visit at our clinic, and you can
          say goodbye to your doctor for good. Your health will be impeccable.
          Your skin will be as clean and tight as new.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;That is incredible. But surely, a treatment such as this could
          cost you an arm and leg.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Not at all. The surgery itself is free. You need to take
          supplements to help with your recovery and to enhance the
          effects.&rdquo; He held up a clear bottle filled with a dark red
          liquid to show the audience. &ldquo;This is what makes the magic
          happen. So make sure you take them every few days, and you will enjoy
          all the benefits with no side effects.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Michael, you already went through this&mdash;treatment. Tell
          us, how do you feel?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Hopkins thought for a moment, then with an honest smile looked at
          Reid and said, &ldquo;Never felt more alive.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Well, you heard it folks, a remedy for seemingly all of our
          mortal ailments.&rdquo; Reid gave a chuckle to the audience. &ldquo;If
          you would like to know more about living a productive and youthful
          life, call our operators or...&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>I did not catch the end of the show. I fell asleep.</p>
        <p>
          After the episode aired, more and more people took the offer of Dr.
          Hopkins. Even I considered it. A month later, the changes could be
          seen nationwide. Workers became more productive, the young more
          energetic, the elderly more youthful. Everyone wanted a taste of Dr.
          Hopkins&rsquo;s remedy. The world seemingly became rejuvenated.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the pharmacies that ran out first, and people quickly exhausted
          their reserved supplements. A few days later, several blood banks
          throughout the country were raided and emptied. Last week, people
          started to disappear from the streets at night. Phil, the weatherman,
          hasn&rsquo;t forecasted sunny since. And I&rsquo;m too afraid to go to
          sleep.
