      <h1>Legal Terms of Use</h1>
      <p>
        <em-oblique>
          Effective date: 15/02/26 | Last updated: 15/02/26.
        </em-oblique>
      </p>
      <p>
        These terms govern the use of content created by Zoltán Forrai
        (hereinafter 'the Author'), a Hungarian national residing in Budapest,
        Hungary, who retains all intellectual property rights to works published
        on this domain. Upon the Author's death or incapacity, these rights and
        the authority to enforce these terms transfer to the Author's designated
        estate representative or legal heirs in accordance with Hungarian
        succession law.
      </p>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws of Hungary, and the substantive law
        of Hungary shall apply to the interpretation, construction, and
        enforcement of these terms. Any disputes will be subject to the
        jurisdiction of the courts of Budapest, Hungary, specifically the
        Budapest-Capital Regional Court (Fővárosi Törvényszék) for first
        instance matters or the appropriate district court based on the claim
        value and nature. Proceedings will be conducted in Hungarian unless
        otherwise agreed by the parties or permitted by the court. However,
        nothing in these terms limits the statutory rights of consumers under EU
        consumer protection law, and EU consumers may bring claims in their
        country of residence where such rights apply. These terms are drafted in
        English, and the English version shall be the authoritative version in
        case of any translation or interpretation disputes.
      </p>

      <h2>Interpretation and Construction</h2>
      <p>
        Section headings and titles in these terms are for convenience and
        reference only and do not affect the interpretation or construction of
        any provision. The words "include," "includes," and "including" shall be
        deemed to be followed by "without limitation." References to "writing"
        or "written" include email and other electronic communications.
        References to calendar days are used throughout unless "business days"
        is explicitly stated. Business days are Monday through Friday, excluding
        Hungarian national holidays, in Central European Time (CET/CEST). When
        time periods are specified in business days, the calculation excludes
        weekends and Hungarian public holidays. Time periods specified in hours
        or days begin at the time of the triggering event (such as receipt of
        notice) and end at 23:59 CET/CEST on the final day. The term "without
        undue delay" means as soon as reasonably practicable under the
        circumstances but in no event more than 5 business days unless a
        specific shorter period is mandated by law.
      </p>

      <h2>Entire Agreement and Severability</h2>
      <p>
        These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Author
        regarding use of this website and supersede all prior or contemporaneous
        understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, whether
        written or oral. If any provision of these terms is found to be
        unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction,
        that provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the
        validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, which shall
        remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision
        shall be replaced with a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
        matches the intent of the original provision.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Beneficiaries</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties hereto
        (the Author and users of the website). Except as explicitly stated with
        respect to credited collaborators and commissioned artists whose work
        appears on this site with proper attribution, no other person or entity
        shall be deemed a third-party beneficiary of these terms or have any
        right to enforce any provision herein. Credited collaborators and
        artists retain their own copyright and enforcement rights as specified
        in the attribution accompanying their work.
      </p>

      <h2>AI Use Policy</h2>
      <p>
        All content on this website, including prose, illustrations, layout, and
        markup, has been created by human authors without the use of artificial
        intelligence systems, with one exception. Certain JavaScript
        functionality has been generated with AI assistance. The website has
        been designed with progressive enhancement principles, ensuring
        accessibility without JavaScript or CSS.
      </p>

      <h2>Website Availability and Access</h2>
      <p>
        The Author makes no guarantee regarding website availability, uptime, or
        uninterrupted access. The Author reserves the right to modify, suspend,
        or discontinue the website or any portion thereof at any time without
        notice. The website may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance,
        updates, technical difficulties, or circumstances beyond the Author's
        control. The Author is not liable for any inability to access the
        website or any loss of data or content resulting from website
        unavailability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Automated access to this website, including but not limited to web
        scraping, crawling, data mining, or use of bots, scripts, or APIs
        (whether official or reverse-engineered) is prohibited without explicit
        written permission from the Author. Permitted automated access by search
        engine crawlers and accessibility tools is excepted. Users may not use
        technical means to circumvent any access controls, security measures, or
        technological protection measures implemented on the website. Users may
        not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the website,
        other accounts, computer systems, or networks connected to the website.
      </p>

      <h2>Linking and External References</h2>
      <p>
        Third parties may link to this website without seeking permission,
        provided the link does not imply endorsement, sponsorship, or
        association without the Author's written consent. Links must not frame
        or alter the appearance of the website content. The Author does not
        endorse and is not responsible for the content of websites that link to
        this site or websites linked from this site. The Author reserves the
        right to request removal of any link that is misleading, defamatory, or
        otherwise objectionable.
      </p>

      <h2>Copyright and Licence</h2>
      <p>
        All content under the domain <a href="/">gildrom.com</a> is the original
        creation of the Author, unless stated otherwise. The Author claims
        copyright protection globally to the fullest extent available under the
        Berne Convention, WIPO Copyright Treaty, and all applicable
        international copyright agreements. Copyright exists in the content from
        the moment of creation regardless of registration status. <br />
        All rights reserved. Any use not explicitly permitted below requires the
        Author's permission. New versions of these terms apply prospectively to
        future use of the website and content, but do not retroactively change
        the terms that applied to content created or accessed under previous
        versions unless explicitly stated otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You may not:</strong> (Prohibited Uses) Copy, remix, republish,
        present as your own, or are otherwise derivative in nature. This is
        especially true if there&rsquo;s any commercial element involved. The
        Author expressly reserves the right to pursue legal action against any
        entity that incorporates this content into machine learning datasets, AI
        training systems, or large language models. While the Author
        acknowledges that proving such use may be technically challenging and
        may require forensic analysis, circumstantial evidence, or industry
        investigation, the Author reserves all available legal remedies. Where
        copyright has been registered prior to infringement, the Author will
        seek maximum statutory damages available under applicable copyright law
        for such violations. Where copyright has not been registered, the Author
        will pursue actual damages and injunctive relief to the fullest extent
        permitted by law. In calculating actual damages, the Author may seek
        expert testimony to establish market value, licensing fees that would
        have been negotiated, and other economically quantifiable harm.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Commercial use means any use where the user or their organization
          receives money, advertising revenue, sponsorship, in-kind
          compensation, or other compensation of any form in connection with the
          Author's work, regardless of whether the entity is for-profit or
          nonprofit. This includes but is not limited to: displaying the content
          alongside advertisements, using the content to attract customers or
          users to a commercial service, incorporating the content into a
          product or service offered for sale or subscription, or using the
          content to enhance the commercial value of any offering.
        </li>
        <li>
          Derivative work means a creation that reproduces, adapts, or builds
          upon the specific expression, distinctive elements, plot, characters,
          or visual style of the Author's work rather than merely being inspired
          by general themes. This determination is based on qualitative
          similarity and substantial similarity tests under applicable copyright
          law.
        </li>

          visual content published on this site.

            Adaptation to a different medium (audio, animation, video, graphics,

          <li>
            Substantial redistribution of any kind, even with attribution.
            <br />
            Substantial redistribution means reproduction of any complete work,
            any excerpt exceeding 500 words, or any portion that, when
            considered in relation to the length and nature of the original
            work, would reasonably substitute for accessing the original work.
            For works under 1,000 words, any excerpt exceeding 20% of the total
            length constitutes substantial redistribution regardless of word
            count. "Reasonably substitute" means the excerpt provides sufficient
            content that a user would no longer need to visit the original
            source to obtain the primary value or information contained in the
            work.

        <p>
          For permissions, contact the Author via the
          <a href="/tavern/contact">contact form</a>, or via
          <a href="mailto:zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com">email</a>. <br />
          For purposes of these terms, &lsquo;written permission&rsquo; means
          explicit authorisation provided by email from
          <em-oblique
            ><a href="mailto:zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com"
              >zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com</a
            ></em-oblique

          granted via email from
          <a href="mailto:zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com"

          are non-transferable, non-exclusive, and limited to the specific use,
          medium, geographic territory, and time period stated in the permission
          unless explicitly stated to be broader. Unless otherwise specified,
          permissions are limited to worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable
          use for the stated purpose and duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Permissions may be revoked or modified by the Author with thirty
          calendar days' written notice if the permitted use materially differs
          from what was originally authorized. Material difference includes but
          is not limited to: using the work in a different medium than
          specified, distributing to a substantially larger audience than
          anticipated (defined as exceeding the originally contemplated audience
          by more than 300% or reaching a completely different demographic or
          geographic market than discussed), using the work for commercial
          purposes when non-commercial use was authorized, sublicensing the work
          to third parties, or combining the work with content that could be
          considered offensive, defamatory, or contrary to the Author's values.
          The Author may also modify permissions to expand the scope, extend the
          duration, or grant additional rights, which shall be communicated in
          writing and take effect upon your acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revocation does not affect works already completed and distributed
          during the permission period, but prohibits future use or distribution
          after the thirty-day notice period expires. "Completed" means a work
          that has been finished in its intended final form and made available
          to its intended audience, not works that are in progress, in draft
          form, or planned but not yet executed. The Author may, at sole
          discretion, allow a reasonable wind-down period (typically 60-90
          calendar days, determined based on the nature and scope of the
          project) for projects substantially underway at the time of revocation
          notice, where "substantially underway" means documented evidence of
          investment exceeding €1,000 (or equivalent in other currencies at the
          exchange rate published by the European Central Bank on the date the
          permission was granted) or 100 hours of work specifically toward the
          permitted use. Acceptable evidence formats include but are not limited
          to: invoices, contracts with third parties, timesheets, payment
          records, work-in-progress materials with verifiable timestamps, or
          other contemporaneous documentation reasonably establishing the
          claimed investment.

        <strong>You may freely:</strong> (Permitted Uses) Critique, parody,
        create fan art, and make other transformative works that fall under
        <em-oblique>fair use</em-oblique> or fair dealing doctrine in your
        jurisdiction. Users are requested to provide credit and link back to the
        original work. Fair use works may be commercialized to the extent
        permitted by applicable fair use or fair dealing law without requiring
        additional permission, though users assume full responsibility for
        ensuring their use qualifies as fair use under relevant jurisdiction.
        This is a legal determination that depends on factors including purpose
        and character of use, nature of the copyrighted work, amount and
        substantiality of portion used, and effect on the market for the
        original work.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          While the Author respects fair use rights under applicable law, users
          uncertain whether their intended use qualifies should contact the
          Author before proceeding to avoid potential disputes. The Author does
          not provide legal advice regarding fair use determinations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users who create fan art are encouraged to share it with the Author
          via the
          <a href="/tavern/contact">contact form</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Attribution must include the title of the work, the Author's name
        (Zoltán Forrai), and a direct link to the original page when the
        original URL is available, appearing adjacent to visual works or
        immediately before/after quoted text. If the original URL becomes
        unavailable, attribution must include the title, author name, original
        publication date if known, and a statement that the work was originally
        published at gildrom.com. Proper attribution does not authorize uses
        that would otherwise require permission, but may be considered a
        mitigating factor in determining appropriate remedies for unauthorized
        use, potentially reducing damages sought or affecting the Author's
        willingness to negotiate a resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you partially comply with a takedown or cease-and-desist request (for
        example, by removing some but not all infringing content, or ceasing
        some but not all infringing uses), the Author will evaluate the partial
        compliance in good faith and may choose to: accept the partial
        compliance as sufficient if it addresses the primary concern, request
        additional specific actions to achieve full compliance, or pursue legal
        remedies if the partial compliance does not adequately address the
        infringement. The Author will communicate clearly which option is being
        pursued.
      </p>
      <p>
        Claims for copyright infringement must be brought within the applicable
        statute of limitations under the law of the jurisdiction where the claim
        is filed. In Hungary, this is generally three years from when the
        infringement was or should reasonably have been discovered. If users use
        the Author's work in ways not permitted by these terms, the Author may
        request removal and reserves the right to pursue legal remedies if
        necessary, including DMCA takedown notices if unauthorized use
        continues. For urgent matters involving active, ongoing copyright
        infringement that is causing immediate and substantial harm, users may
        mark their communication as "URGENT COPYRIGHT MATTER" in the subject
        line, and the Author will prioritize review and response, typically
        within 24-48 hours during business days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commissioned illustrations, collaborative projects, are always cited as
        such. Attribution is given in this format, directly next to the piece:
        &ldquo;<em-oblique>Art by: [name] — [portfolio URL]</em-oblique>
        &rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collaborative works are subject to the rights of their respective
        creators in addition to any rights held by the Author, and users should
        not assume they have permission without checking with the credited
        creator. If users receive permission from the Author for use of a
        collaborative work, that permission extends only to the Author's
        contributions unless the Author explicitly confirms having authority to
        grant permission for the entire work. Users remain responsible for
        obtaining necessary permissions from other rights holders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Permissions granted for adaptations do not automatically grant rights to
        further adapt the adaptation. For example, if you receive permission to
        create an audio version of a story, that permission does not authorize
        others to create a video based on your audio version, nor does it
        authorize you to create a video based on your own audio version, without
        separate permission. Each level of adaptation requires its own
        permission from the original copyright holder.
      </p>

        Hungary, or the jurisdiction where the claim is brought) arising from
        your violation of these terms, your use of the website or content, your
        infringement of any intellectual property or other right of any person

        obligation survives termination of your use of the website. You will
        cooperate fully with the Author in the defense of any claim subject to
        indemnification.
      </p>

      <h2>User Conduct and Prohibited Content</h2>
      <p>
        This website does not currently permit user-generated content such as
        comments, uploads, or contributions. If such features are added in the
        future, they will be governed by additional terms and conditions that
        will be clearly communicated at that time. Users are prohibited from
        attempting to post, upload, or otherwise add content to the website
        through any means including exploitation of technical vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <h2>Assignment and Transfer</h2>
      <p>
        The Author reserves the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any
        rights or obligations under these terms to any party, including but not
        limited to in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate

        consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of this provision is
        void.

      <p>
        The Author cannot track users, collect analytics about user identity,
        geographic location, reading habits, or duration of visits. This is by
        design. The Author does not have user data to sell or share.

      <p>
        Users may browse this website anonymously or pseudonymously. The Author
        does not require identity verification for general website access.
        However, for certain interactions such as permission requests or
        contractual arrangements, the Author may need to verify identity to
        ensure enforceability of agreements. Users who choose to identify
        themselves do so voluntarily.

      <p>
        The Author does not intentionally set cookies or use tracking
        technologies on this website. However, third-party services used to
        deliver this website (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare) may set their own

      <h3>Age Restrictions and Minors</h3>
      <p>
        This website is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly
        target or collect information from children under the age of 16.
        Individuals under 16 may browse the website freely, but must have
        parental or legal guardian consent before submitting any information
        through the contact form. Verifiable parental consent means that a
        parent or legal guardian must either: (a) submit the contact form
        themselves on the minor's behalf, clearly identifying themselves as the
        parent/guardian and providing their own contact information, or (b)
        provide written confirmation via email from the parent/guardian's email
        address confirming consent for the minor's submission. The Author does
        not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from individuals
        under 16 without verifiable parental consent. If the Author becomes
        aware that personal information has been collected from a child under 16
        without parental consent, reasonable steps will be taken to delete such
        information promptly.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Processing and Your Rights</h3>
      <p>
        When using the contact form, users may provide an
        <strong>email</strong> address. In this case, users are no longer
        anonymous, but this is entirely voluntary. The Author will only use
        provided email addresses to respond to inquiries, will not share email
        addresses with third parties, and will not add users to any mailing list
        for marketing purposes. The Author's reply address is
        <em-oblique
          ><a href="mailto:zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com"
            >zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com</a
          ></em-oblique
        >. The Author does not validate or authenticate email addresses provided
        through the contact form beyond basic format checking. Users are
        responsible for providing accurate, working email addresses. Automated
        acknowledgments from the contact form system (if any) do not constitute
        official responses from the Author; only direct email responses from
        <a href="mailto:zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com">zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com</a>
        constitute official communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        The legal basis for processing email addresses is legitimate interest in
        responding to inquiries, or where applicable, the performance of a
        contract or pre-contractual measures at the user's request. By
        submitting information through the contact form, users consent to
        receive electronic communications from the Author in response to their
        inquiry. Email correspondence will be retained for a maximum of two
        years from the date of last communication, after which it will be
        permanently deleted. This retention period applies regardless of whether
        the Author responded to the email. Business necessity for extended
        retention includes ongoing contractual negotiations, unresolved
        disputes, pending permissions that reference the correspondence, legal
        obligations requiring retention (such as tax records for any payments
        made, accounting records, or ongoing investigations), or other
        legitimate business purposes that will be evaluated on a case-by-case
        basis. In such cases, affected users will be notified of the extended
        retention, the specific reason, and the anticipated retention period.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rights under GDPR (for EU users):</strong> EU users have the
        right to request access to their personal data, request correction of
        inaccurate data, request deletion of their data (subject to legal
        retention obligations), object to processing, request restriction of
        processing, request data portability (data will be provided in commonly
        used electronic format such as PDF or plain text), and withdraw consent
        where processing is based on consent. EU users also have the right to
        lodge a complaint with their national data protection supervisory
        authority if they believe their rights have been violated. The Author
        does not engage in automated decision-making or profiling that produces
        legal effects or similarly significantly affects individuals. For
        purposes of these terms, "similarly significantly affects" means
        decisions that have comparable impact to legal effects, such as
        automatic denial of services, significant financial impact, or
        substantial effects on circumstances, behavior, or choices. To exercise
        any of these rights, users may contact the Author at
        <em-oblique
          ><a href="mailto:zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com"
            >zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com</a
          ></em-oblique
        >
        with "Data Rights Request" in the subject line. The Author will respond
        within one month (30 calendar days) of receiving a valid request. This
        period may be extended by two additional months where necessary, taking
        into account the complexity and number of requests, in which case users
        will be informed of the extension and reasons within one month of the
        original request.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all data protection inquiries, concerns, or rights requests, contact
        the Author directly at
        <em-oblique
          ><a href="mailto:zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com"
            >zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com</a
          ></em-oblique
        >. As a small-scale operation, the Author acts as the primary contact
        for all data protection matters and does not maintain a separate Data
        Protection Officer position.
      </p>

      <h3>Correspondence Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>
        Communications with the Author via email or contact form are generally
        treated as confidential and will not be publicly disclosed without the
        sender's consent, except: (a) where required by law, legal process, or
        court order, (b) where necessary to enforce these terms or protect the
        Author's rights, (c) where the correspondence itself constitutes
        evidence of terms violations or illegal activity, or (d) where the
        sender has made the same or substantially similar communications public.
        The Author may share anonymized or aggregated information about types of
        inquiries received without identifying specific individuals.
      </p>

      <h3>Third-Party Data Processing</h3>
      <p>
        The contact form relies on
        <a href="https://formsubmit.co/">formsubmit.co</a>, they have their own
        <a href="https://formsubmit.co/privacy.pdf">privacy policy</a>.
        Gildrom.com is hosted on
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub Pages</a>, the DNS
        name is provided by
        <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>. By using this
        website, you acknowledge that each may collect data according to their
        own policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        These third parties act as independent data controllers for any data
        they collect through their services. The Author has selected service
        providers that maintain appropriate security measures and, where
        applicable, comply with GDPR standards, but the Author does not have
        direct control over their data processing activities. GitHub and
        Cloudflare are US-based companies that may process data internationally.
        By using this site, users acknowledge data may be transferred outside
        Hungary and the European Economic Area. These transfers are subject to
        appropriate safeguards as required by GDPR, specifically Standard
        Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, adequacy
        decisions where applicable (such as the EU-US Data Privacy Framework if
        the processor is certified), and binding corporate rules where the
        processor has implemented them. Users may request specific information
        about the safeguards applicable to their data by contacting the Author.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this site is designed with anonymity in mind, the Author cannot
        guarantee user privacy due to the third-party infrastructure required to
        deliver the site. While the Author does not directly collect user data
        beyond contact form submissions, this site relies on third-party
        infrastructure that may process data according to their own policies.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Breach Notification</h3>
      <p>
        In the event that the Author becomes aware of a data breach affecting
        personal information under the Author's control (such as email
        correspondence), the Author will comply with applicable data breach
        notification requirements under GDPR and Hungarian law. A breach is
        considered to present "high risk to rights and freedoms" when it could
        result in identity theft, fraud, financial loss, reputational damage,
        unauthorized reversal of pseudonymization, or other significant economic
        or social disadvantage to affected individuals. This includes notifying
        the relevant supervisory authority (the Hungarian National Authority for
        Data Protection and Freedom of Information, NAIH) within 72 hours of
        becoming aware of the breach, where feasible, and notifying affected
        individuals without undue delay where the breach is likely to result in
        a high risk to their rights and freedoms. If a data breach occurs at a
        third-party service provider (such as formsubmit.co, GitHub Pages, or
        Cloudflare), the Author's notification obligations depend on whether the
        Author is made aware of the breach by the service provider. Users
        concerned about breaches should also monitor notifications from these
        third-party services directly.
      </p>

      <h3>Legal Process and Subpoenas</h3>
      <p>
        If the Author receives a subpoena, court order, or other legal process
        requesting user information, the Author will: (a) verify the legitimacy
        of the request, (b) object to or narrow overly broad requests where
        legally appropriate, (c) provide notice to affected users if legally
        permitted and practically feasible, giving them opportunity to challenge
        the request, and (d) disclose only the minimum information legally
        required. The Author will not voluntarily provide user information to
        law enforcement or third parties without legal compulsion or the user's
        consent except as described in the Correspondence Confidentiality
        section above.
      </p>

      <h2>Content Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        This website and all content are provided 'as is' without warranties of
        any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of
        merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy,
        completeness, or non-infringement, and you use this site at your own
        risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Author disclaims
        liability for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages
        arising from your use of this website or reliance on any content here.
        This disclaimer does not exclude or limit liability for death or
        personal injury caused by negligence, fraud or fraudulent
        misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or
        limited under applicable law, including mandatory consumer protection
        rights under EU law. Nothing on this website constitutes professional
        advice of any kind, including but not limited to legal, financial,
        medical, or technical advice. "Professional advice" means advice that
        would legally require the advisor to hold specific professional
        qualifications, licensing, or credentials to provide such advice in a
        professional capacity for compensation. If you need professional advice,
        consult an appropriately qualified professional, meaning an individual
        who holds the necessary credentials, licensing, and experience in the
        relevant field and jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content shared on this website about grammar, literature, language, or
        craft represents the Author's own research and ideas. The Author is not
        a professional linguist, literary scholar, or writing coach. Content on
        these topics represents the Author's understanding, which may contain
        errors or limitations. Users are encouraged to exercise critical
        thinking and seek additional sources when appropriate.
      </p>

      <h2>Force Majeure</h2>
      <p>
        The Author shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing
        obligations under these terms where such failure or delay results from
        circumstances beyond the Author's reasonable control, including but not
        limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots,
        embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods,
        accidents, pandemics, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities,
        fuel, energy, labor or materials, or failure of third-party service
        providers including but not limited to internet service providers,
        hosting providers, and email services. During any such period of delay
        or non-performance, the Author's obligations are suspended, and the time
        for performance is extended for the duration of the force majeure event
        plus a reasonable resumption period. A reasonable resumption period is
        typically 5-10 business days to restore normal operations, though this
        may be longer for severe events and will be communicated to affected
        users if specific commitments were in place.
      </p>

      <h2>Alternative Contact Methods</h2>
      <p>
        If the primary email address (<a href="mailto:zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com"
          >zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com</a
        >) is unavailable due to technical issues, or if the contact form is not
        functioning, users may attempt to reach the Author through the following
        alternative methods in order of preference: (a) wait 48-72 hours and
        retry the primary contact method, (b) check the website homepage for any
        posted notices about alternative contact information, or (c) for urgent
        copyright matters only, research publicly available contact information
        for the domain owner through WHOIS records (understanding that such
        information may not lead directly to the Author due to privacy
        protection services). The Author will make reasonable efforts to restore
        primary contact methods promptly and will post notice on the website
        homepage if extended outages are anticipated.
      </p>

      <h2>Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        This website will never have any third-party dynamic advertisement.
        <br />
        Occasionally the Author may create a banner or write a post promoting a
        project, sometimes for compensation. In such cases, promotional content
        will be clearly marked as such.
      </p>

      <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        If a dispute arises regarding these terms or use of this website, users
        agree to first attempt to resolve the matter informally by contacting
        the Author at
        <em-oblique
          ><a href="mailto:zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com"
            >zoltan.forrai@gildrom.com</a
          ></em-oblique
        >
        with a detailed description of the dispute. The Author will make
        commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute amicably within
        thirty calendar days. "Commercially reasonable efforts" means the Author
        will dedicate appropriate time and attention to understanding and
        attempting to resolve the dispute, but is not required to accept
        unfavorable terms or compromise legal rights. This includes at minimum:
        acknowledging receipt of dispute notices within 5 business days,
        engaging in at least one substantive exchange of positions and proposed
        resolutions, and providing a final position statement if resolution
        cannot be reached. If informal resolution is unsuccessful after thirty
        calendar days, either party may pursue formal legal remedies as provided
        in these terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        This informal dispute resolution requirement does not apply to claims
        seeking immediate injunctive relief or where immediate legal action is
        necessary to prevent irreparable harm. "Irreparable harm" means harm
        that cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages and would
        cause permanent or long-lasting damage to the Author's rights or
        interests, such as ongoing copyright infringement that is causing
        demonstrable market harm, imminent unauthorized disclosure of
        confidential information, or threats to the Author's reputation that
        cannot be remedied through later correction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in these terms shall be construed as a waiver of either party's
        right to bring disputes individually. These terms do not require
        arbitration or mediation as mandatory pre-litigation steps, though
        parties may voluntarily agree to such alternative dispute resolution
        methods. The Author does not waive the right to participate in or opt
        out of class action proceedings as permitted by applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>Waiver and Modification</h2>
      <p>
        No failure or delay by the Author in exercising any right, power, or
        privilege under these terms shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
        any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege
        preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
        other right, power, or privilege. No waiver shall be effective unless in
        writing and signed by the Author. Any modification or amendment to these
        terms must be in writing and explicitly identified as an amendment to be
        binding on the Author. Amendments may be posted on this page with
        updated effective dates.
      </p>

      <h2>Survival of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        Upon termination of use of this website or these terms (whether by user
        choice or the Author's revocation of permission), the following
        provisions shall survive: all intellectual property provisions,
        indemnification obligations, limitations of liability, dispute
        resolution procedures, data retention obligations until applicable
        periods expire, and any other provisions that by their nature should
        survive termination to give effect to their meaning. Termination does
        not affect permissions already properly granted for completed works or
        uses that occurred during the permission period in compliance with these
        terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        The Author maintains version control of these terms and will retain
        dated versions to document what terms were in effect at any given time.
        Users who accepted or used the website under previous versions may
        reference those versions if disputes arise regarding use that occurred
        under those prior terms. The Author may update these terms from time to
        time. Material changes are defined as any modification that: reduces
        user rights or permissions under these terms, expands the Author's
        ability to use user information, changes dispute resolution procedures
        in ways that could adversely affect user ability to bring claims, alters
        liability limitations in ways that could adversely affect users, or
        changes the fundamental nature of what content is permitted or
        prohibited. Material changes that affect user rights will be announced
        with at least 30 calendar days' advance notice, which will include
        posting a prominent notice on the website homepage. "Prominent notice"
        means a notice displayed at the top of the homepage in a font size and
        color that makes it immediately visible to users, or a dedicated banner
        or announcement section that users will see before accessing other
        content. Where the Author has user contact information for an ongoing
        matter (such as an active permission or unresolved dispute), affected
        users will also be notified directly via email. Continued use after
        receiving notice of material changes constitutes acceptance of those
        changes. For non-material changes (such as clarifications, formatting
        updates, corrections that do not substantially alter user rights or
        obligations, or additions that expand user rights), continued use after
        changes are posted constitutes acceptance. Specific written permissions
        already granted remain valid under their original terms regardless of
        subsequent changes to these terms, unless both parties agree in writing
        to modify a specific permission. Users may not continue using the
        website if they do not accept material changes to these terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact and Correspondence</h2>
      <p>
        If you initiate correspondence with the Author regarding permissions,
        disputes, data rights, or any ongoing matter, users are responsible for
        maintaining valid and current contact information and monitoring that
        contact method for responses. The Author is not responsible for failed
        communications due to outdated contact information, full mailboxes, spam
        filters, or other technical issues on the user's end. For official
        notices under these terms, the Author will use the most recent contact
        information provided. If contact information changes during an ongoing
        matter, users must promptly notify the Author of the updated
        information.
      </p>

      <br /><br />

      <p>
        If users have concerns about potential infringement or other issues,
        they are encouraged to contact the Author first to resolve matters
        amicably before pursuing formal action.
